# 🎮 Tetris Game in Unity

This is a classic **Tetris game** built using **Unity**, demonstrating solid software architecture principles by leveraging the **Observer** and **State** design patterns. The project is designed with maintainability and scalability in mind, making it a great reference for anyone interested in applying design patterns in game development.

## 🧠 Design Patterns Used

### ✅ Observer Pattern
Used to implement communication between various game systems such as:
- Score updates
- UI changes
- Game over events
- Piece spawning and board updates

This allows components to be **decoupled**, improving flexibility and reducing dependencies.

### ✅ State Pattern
Used to manage different game states:
- **Main Menu**
- **Playing**
- **Paused**
- **Game Over**

Each state encapsulates its own behavior, enabling clean transitions and organized code.


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in **Unity** (tested with version `20XX.X.X`).
3. Open the `Scenes/MainScene`.
4. Hit the **Play** button.
